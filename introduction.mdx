## Overview

Our Agent API allows you to build AI NPCs, Assistants, Friends within your own Games or Apps. An Agent can be defined by its own system prompts as well as a set of other core functions you might want it to leverage: voice, actions, knowledge and more.

You can explore the capabilities of our Agents using our AI Playground tool or by building one with the 4-step Devs Quickstart Guide.
