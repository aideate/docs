## Overview

Our Character API allows you to build AI NPCs, assistants, or teammates that you can easily integrate with your games and apps. A Character is defined by its own system prompt as well as other core functions you could leverage: Actions and Voices (beta).

You can explore the functionalities of our Characters using the [Genova Labs Playground](https://playground.genova.gg/). If you're looking for a quick setup, check out our [4-step Quickstart Guide](/quickstart-guide) to get started!
