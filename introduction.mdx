## Overview

Our Character API allows you to build AI NPCs, Assistants, Friends within your own Games or Apps. A Character can be defined by its own system prompts as well as a set of other core functions you might want it to leverage: voice, actions, knowledge and more.

You can explore the capabilities of our Characters using our AI Playground tool or by building one with the 4-step Devs Quickstart Guide.
